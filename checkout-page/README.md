## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I had the chance to recap and practise working with CSS grids, Flex and Mobile-First working. 
I did not copy copy the design of the page with the time that I had, instead, I just made it look similar.

I had to think outside the box and try new ideas each time I worked on a new section.


### Continued development


I still need some more practice with grid and flexbox. I do understand it, but it is easy to forget if not used frequently.
I will be looking at some interactive sites for this which I have found useful in the past, such as Flexbox Froggy.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - I used W3Schools for concise explanations and demos. I have always come away with better understandings of concepts with this site.
- [Mozilla CSS Grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - I visited this site to consolidate my understanding of css grids. I highly recommend you check it out!


## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Oliver Cadman for his lessons and explanations on css and working with grids. He's always there to lend a hand if need be!
